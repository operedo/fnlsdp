 
PCSDP 1.0 distributed memory SDP solver installation manual

[Copyright (C) 2007  PCSDP Project]

  This file explains how to install the the distributed
  memory SDP splver PCSDP 1.0.
  If you have any problems with installation process, please
  send us an e-mail ( i.d.ivanov_at_ewi.tudelft.nl ).

  In this manual we assume that:

  1. You have BLAS, LAPACK libraries installed already.
  
  2. You have also installed BLACS and ScaLAPACK libraries from
      http://www.netlib.org/blacs/
      and 
      http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/ 
      respectively.
  
  3. You have MPI installed and configured on your cluster
   
  4. You have a knowledge of how to compile and 
     use the MPICH program.

In this manual, we also assume that your operating 
system is "Linux" such as "Red Hat". PCSDP should work on 
other Unix-like operating systems as well.

The line whose starts with the character '$' 
indicates a command you should execute.

  We have tested the installation on a "Red Hat EL2" and "Scientific Linux"
with "mpich-1.2.6"  and "mpich-1.2.7", respectively.

I. Instalation of PCSDP
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Pre-instalation procedures

We assume that you downloaded the package pcsdp1.0gplR1.tar.gz,
into directory with name $SOME_DIR and you executed:

$ tar xzvf pcsdp1.0gplR1.tar.gz
$ cd pcsdp1.0gplR1/


2. Go to your ScaLAPACK source directory, say $(PATH_TO_SCALAPAK),
and copy all header files from $(PATH_TO_SCALAPACK)/PBLAS/SRC/
into the /include directory of PCSDP. For example:

$ cp $(PATH_TO_SCALAPACK)/PBLAS/SRC/*.h $(SOME_DIR)/pcsdp1.0gplR1/include/

The following 5 files have to be copied: PBblacs.h, PBblas.h, 
PBpblas.h, PBtools.h, pblas.h; 

3. Customize the Makefiles

$ cd $(SOME_DIR)/pcsdp1.0gplR1/lib

 - Edit the Makefile
 
   line   4  :: CC=mpicc
   line   8  :: CFLAGS= -O3 -I../include 
       
   In case you compile  with 64bit C compiler use -DBIT64, so:
       line  8  :: CFLAGS= -O3 -I../include -DBIT64

$ cd ../solver

 - Edit the Makefile
   line   4  :: CC=mpicc
   line   5  :: F77=mpif77

   If mpich C and FORTRAN compile wrappers are different
   than 'mpicc' and 'mpif77', then change them with the correct
   ones above.

   line  17  :: CFLAGS= -O3 -I../include 

   In case you compile  with 64bit C compiler use -DBIT64, so:
       line  17  :: CFLAGS= -O3 -I../include -DBIT64
       
   The following FORTRAN flags should prevent double underscore in 
   function names when linking to algebra libraries.           
       
   line 25 :: FFLAGS= -fno-second-underscore
  
   If the compilation does not go smoothly, its a good idea to link
   also against the following libraries:
       line  45  ::  LIBLM=  -lm  -lg2c

$ cd ..
$ make clean
$ make
$ cd solver/

After e successful build process, the executable pcsdp is in 
directory /solver. To start PCSDP on your cluster you need to use the available
tools as "prun" or alternatively if you have a "SGE" queueing 
system you can use a 'sge' script. For more details on how to
use PCSDP we refer to the user's manual in the doc directory. 
 
We suggest also that you check the results for the SDP problems
in the /testprob subdirectory of /solver to be sure that the
processes are running.
